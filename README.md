### Installation
- follow [Infer installation instructions](http://fbinfer.com/docs/getting-started.html)
- clone or download zip, build project & restart Xcode (until we get it sorted with Alcatraz)

### Running Infer
- in Xcode, go to `Product` -> `Infer`
- after a couple of minutes (sorry no indicator for now, PR-s welcome) you should see warnings as in image above
- I suggest you start off by checking if it works on the provided sample app `HelloWorldApp` that comes with Infer

### Disclaimer
